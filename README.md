## Project Euler Problems
+ [My Git]()
+ [Project Euler Website](https://projecteuler.net/about)
+ [Free Code Camp hosting of Project Euler](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/)

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) is a set of hosted computational problems intended challenge coders. The first 100 problems are considered easier than what follows and are considered appropriate for beginers. My git contains the problems, programs to solve the problem (some written in several languages), and the solutions.

### Roadmap
Eventually I will move the problem - solution sets into a database for querying and make a free intellij course based on the material.

### License
I don't own the material but it is Creative-Commons licensed for non-commercial use. Any code that is unique to me you can consider Apache 2.0
